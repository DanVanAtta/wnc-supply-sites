<div class="mission-statement larger-font">
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Dan Van Atta, a professional software engineer. I created WNC Supply Sites after volunteering in Asheville.
    What started as a simple shared spreadsheet to track surplus supplies quickly grew into something much bigger: a
    platform that helps connect supply sites and make sure materials get where they're needed most.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work done at distribution sites is incredible, but overwhelming. Very overwhelming. While sorting
    supplies, I was shown just a huge pile of hand sanitizer. Enough for the whole town and then some. In the
    middle of a row of pallets was a full box of solar powered cell phone chargers. Just sitting there, buried.
    When I first started volunteering, my dad told me that supply sites were distributing supplies amongst each other.
    I asked the logistics manager if there was communication between supply sites about surpluses. The answer was, "Not
    really." That's when I realized something had to change.
  </p>
  <p>
    How could we make sure surplus supplies reached the right places? How could we use the supplies already available
    more effectively? And how could we support volunteers working long hours, many of whom were also affected by the
    storm?
  </p>
  <p>

    That's why I created WNC Supply Sites. Our goal is simple: to provide an easy-to-use tool that helps track supplies,
    identify surpluses, and connect supply sites with each other. This way, materials can get to where they're needed,
    quickly and efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    WNC Supply Sites is designed to help volunteers and organizations in disaster relief work smarter, to extend
    their reach and efforts. My hope is that this platform makes it easier to manage supplies, so those helping
    communities recover can focus on the important work of rebuilding and supporting those in need.
